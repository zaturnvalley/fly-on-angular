#Combining Angular and Express

Using the Airplanes API starter that we set up in class, create an Angular CRUD app that does the following.

##Requirements

* Displays all airplanes contained by our API
  * Each airplane should have a link to a show page
  * Each airplane should also have an image (will involve altering the Airplane schema)
  * There should be a search bar that can filter the list of airplanes
* Allows creation of new airplanes

##Getting Started

* Work with 1-2 other people if desired
* Ensure that the API endpoints are working as expected, using a client like Postman
* Think about the design of the app and the components necessary
  * Views (via the Angular router)
  * Resources (via Angular resource)
  * Organization (data, controllers, services)
  * Forms (search bar, new airplane)
* Make it look good (CSS)
* Work incrementally and save work frequently (via git)
